## Collaborators Notes
Accept pull request  
Switch to main branch  
do `npm install` to have new dependencies download for you.  
do `npm run watch` to have docs/bundle.js recompiled from docs/main.js whenever it changes.  
Looks like a good idea to terminate the watch before switching branches.

and see if everything works as expected.
My first time properly dabbling with all of this also :)

In theory should be possible to delete local copy. Clone this. and ```npm``` install will bring you back to where you need to be.
Edit - I just did exactly that. Worked perfectly.

`npm run watch` - rebrowserfies things on change
`npm run dev` - starts auto updating server.

Have also been playing around with 'now' (Would need to install seperately) For insta publishing node projects.
